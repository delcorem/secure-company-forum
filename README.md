# secure-company-forum
A company forum website built primarily with Java using Spring framework. A user inputs their username and password to login to the website, 
and their login information and encrypted password is stored in a database. They can then contribute to a company discussion 
page where they can submit responses that are stored in a database, and they can then view all the comments on the page. 
I utilized Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Lombok, Spring Data JDBC, Spring Security, and H2 (DBMS) to complete the website.
